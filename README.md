# SOC Endpoint & Incident Response Labs

This repository documents hands-on security controls and simulations focused on
endpoint protection and SOC incident response.

## Focus Areas
- Endpoint enforcement and insider threat mitigation
- SOC alert triage and noise reduction
- Incident response thinking and containment strategy

## Why This Repository Exists
Modern SOC teams fail not due to lack of tools, but due to alert overload,
weak endpoint controls, and unclear response actions.

This repository demonstrates how small, practical controls
can significantly improve detection, triage, and response outcomes.

## Labs Included
1. USB-based endpoint lock control
2. SOC alert triage automation
3. Incident response walkthroughs

Each lab focuses on real operational thinking, not theoretical attacks.
